    <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>I was born in Houston, Texas, on the 19th day, of the 3rd month, in the 3rd year
        of the new millenium.</p>

    <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>I go to Clear Lake High School along with my friends, my friends and I
        have some crackpot ideas of having fun, such as getting stuck in quicksand or
        almost having their face bit off by a huge dog. This one time we had raced
        a Camaro.</p>
